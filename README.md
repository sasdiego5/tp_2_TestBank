This project is creating test manually from a Question Library(TestBank).
Vision 

Introduction 

We envision an automated application to generate a Java or Python exam. The questions will be chosen at random from a question library or database. User interaction will be performed through a user interface mechanism, which will include the exam itself and generate as a result graded exam.   

Stakeholder Descriptions 

Professor:  Who uses this application to give the student exam and get their grade to know the level of student’s knowledge in Java and Python.   

Developers team:  Who develop this application, test whether this application can work right.  

Student: Who uses this application to take the exam and get the grade to see the level of their knowledge in Java and Python.  

Key High-Level Goals 

Fast, accurate, comprehensive and integrated exam generator in order to automate the process of creating and grading a test.  

Save time on grading and creating exams and decrease the use of printed paper. 

Determine student’s expertise in Java and Python  

User-Level Goals 

The Professor: develops the test, assigns the test, grades the test, expects accurate score, expects enhanced time management, assess the expertise of the student in Java and Python 

The students: takes the exam, expects accurate score 


Summary of System Features:  

According to the user’s specifications, generate Java and Python exam automatically. 

Grade the exam automatically. 

Record the student profile, grade and generate the report for the professor. 

Have several different Java and Python exam questions inside a database.  

Able to sort between multiple choice, true/false and written questions
